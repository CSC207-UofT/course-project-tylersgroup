# Specification	

The programs begins by pulling up a home screen where the user is prompted to either login or create an account. If the user decides to log in and their details are invalid then they are asked to create a user by inputting their username and password information. After that they are taken to a main screen where they have the option to create a playlist or manage their old playlist or update account details. If they choose to create a playlist they are prompted to enter a string of words which is then spliced into songs and a playlist is created and assigned to their user. If they choose to manage playlists they can view and then delete or edit their old playlists. Finally if they choose to update account information they can edit their username and password. They can also log out from the homescreen which will then take them back to the login screen.
