Spotify allows the functionality to create ordered playlists to sort and save songs which are then shareable with other users. This then led to people creating playlists where the title of each song creates a sentence.
Our program will generate a playlist (group of songs) based on a string input by the user. These then get assigned to the  userâ€™s account and the user can also edit the contents of the playlists. This allows users of our program (with pre-existing spotify accounts) to be able to create custom playlists with ease, outside of their spotify application.
