# SpottyApp

Spotify allows users to create playlists in which users can sort and save songs. As avid Spotify users, these customizable playlists inspired us to create a SpottyApp which can create playlists in which the titles of each song form a meaningful sentence.

SpottyApp is a playlist generator which generates playlists (group of songs) based on a string input by the user. These playlists can be added to the user’s account. This allows SpottyApp users who have Spotify accounts to be able to create custom playlists with ease, explore new songs, and get to know up-and-coming albums without using Spotify.

Simply by entering a meaningful sentence in SpottyApp, it will automatically generate a playlist. This will allow you to dive into the world of music you have never explored before.
